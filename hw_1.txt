1. Your experience with web archtecture. Have you 
written 
HTML before? Written Javascript? etc.
I don’t have much experience with web architecture (yet 
:). I can write some basic HTML/CSS, haven’t learned 
Javascript but really want to learn it. Through this 
class, I hope to change my current feeling of inadequacy 
towards building websites.

2. What are your favorite features from at least 2 
browsers?
Chrome: No popup command boxes. Everything opens up neatly 
in a tab.
Firefox: I don’t have a favorite Firefox feature. But I 
like its interface design. :)
